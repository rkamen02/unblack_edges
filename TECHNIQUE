TECHNIQUE Document

One technique that we started using this term was planning out what functions
we will use before actually writing any code.

To do this, explicitly write out what your overall program needs to do and
thoroughly think about how to achieve this overarching goal while conforming
to all standards and specifications. Then, think about how you will do this
by breaking the solution into steps. These steps should all be individual
functions. Think about what these functions will take and return and how these
functions will interact with each other. This will easily enable you not 
only to spot issues in your logic but also to write prettier code that is
easier to read and understand. This plan is much less prone to error than
writing down all of the code and then breaking it into functions later. Being
proactive will save you lots of time in spotting errors.
