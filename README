The README document.

The TAs and Professor helped us a lot, we bounced a few ideas around with
Tucker Jaenicke but nothing specific.

To the best of our knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly. To 
parallel Hanson's Bit_T interface in which he allowed the user modify 
multiple bits at once and  "not" bits, we have included indetical (in practice)
functions in our interace. 

We spent approximately 26 hours on this project.
